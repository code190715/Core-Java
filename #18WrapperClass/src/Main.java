/* 

Further Notes:

wrapper classes = 
provide a way to use primitive data  types as reference data types
+reference data types contain useful methods
+can be used with certain collections, like ArrayList
-slower to accesses 

Naming convention = First Letter is Capital and spelt in Full

auto-boxing = automatic conversion the java compiler makes between primitive data types and their respected wrapper class

un-boxing = reverse of auto-boxing. Automatic conversion of wrapper class to primitive
